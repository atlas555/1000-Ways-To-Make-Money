# 1000-Ways-To-Make-Money
In the current market environment, considering diversified sources of income (such as passive income or asset returns) is particularly important. This becomes even more significant in the face of worsening market conditions and challenges like the domestic career crisis at age 35.

As a senior technical expert in the field of big data, my day-to-day work is mainly focused on professional tasks within the company. However, in my spare time, I have been contemplating how to use my professional skills to generate additional income. During this process, I faced two main challenges: first, ensuring I devote enough time and energy to my primary job; second, due to my own cognitive and thinking limitations, I am unclear on how to transform my skills into additional financial gain.

Therefore, I initiated this project. It aims to document the various money-making methods I have explored, and I will only include those methods which I can prove or see have profit potential. Regardless of the amount, these methods are intended to broaden thinking and perspective on making money.
